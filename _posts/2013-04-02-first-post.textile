summary: A blog is born.

You don't just go headsdown into books for several months and emerge victoriously as a software developer. There is a whole meta and social part of the community that's just as important. Being able to read and share code is just as important as writing new code.

Github has become an essential tool (with great understatement). I'm looking forward to using this blog engine and Github as my server, score free hosting!
